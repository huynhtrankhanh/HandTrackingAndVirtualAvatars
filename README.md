# Camera Tracking and Virtual Avatars
## Introduction
We together have developed the Camera Tracking and Virtual Avatars application, which consists of 5 fearfully and wonderfully made demos.

The demos can be accessed online and don't require any installation process.

* Frog: https://avatarvirt.netlify.app/frog.html
* Hand: https://avatarvirt.netlify.app/hand.html
* Tiger: https://avatarvirt.netlify.app/tiger.html

The demos speak volumes. In fact, they are more powerful than all the words that we can manage to say here.
## Related Work
The field of real-time camera tracking and virtual avatar animation has seen significant growth, driven by advancements in machine learning and computer vision. Our work builds upon several key frameworks and methodologies that have defined the current landscape of browser-based motion capture.
### 1. MediaPipe Framework
**MediaPipe**, developed by Google, serves as the primary backbone for many modern tracking applications. It offers a suite of cross-platform, customizable ML solutions for live and streaming media.
 * **Hand Tracking:** MediaPipe Hands utilizes an efficient pipeline that provides 21 3D hand landmarks from a single frame. This is crucial for applications requiring high-precision gesture recognition.
 * **Face Mesh:** For facial avatars, MediaPipe Face Mesh estimates 468 3D face landmarks in real-time, allowing for detailed mapping of expressions and lip-syncing without the need for depth sensors.
 * **Holistic Tracking:** The MediaPipe Holistic pipeline integrates components for a combined hand, face, and pose perception, which is essential for full-body virtual representation.
### 2. OpenCV and Classical Computer Vision
Before the ubiquity of pre-trained ML models, **OpenCV** (Open Source Computer Vision Library) was the standard for tracking.
 * **Haar Cascades:** Traditionally used for face detection, though limited in capturing the nuance of expressions compared to deep learning models.
 * **Optical Flow:** Techniques like Lucas-Kanade are often used in conjunction with landmark detectors to smooth jitter and track movement between frames.
 * **Integration:** Many modern applications still use OpenCV for image preprocessing, such as grayscale conversion, denoising, and coordinate transformations, before passing frames to a neural network.
### 3. Deep Learning-Based Pose Estimation
Beyond MediaPipe, several academic and industry models have pushed the boundaries of accuracy:
 * **OpenPose:** One of the first multi-person 2D real-time keypoint detection systems. While highly accurate, it often requires significant GPU resources, making it less ideal for lightweight web applications.
 * **DensePose:** Developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR), this moves beyond landmarks by mapping all human pixels of an RGB image to a 3D surface of the human body, providing a much richer "skin" for virtual avatars.
### 4. Web-Based Rendering and Animation
Tracking is only half of the challenge; the other half is mapping that data to a 3D model.
 * **Three.js & Babylon.js:** These libraries are the industry standards for rendering 3D content in the browser. They allow developers to take tracking coordinates and apply them to rigged 3D models via **Inverse Kinematics (IK)** or direct bone rotation.
 * **Kalidokit:** A specialized library often used alongside MediaPipe to translate raw landmark data into natural-looking rotations for 3D avatars (VRM models), handling the complex math required for "human-like" movement.
### 5. ARCore and ARKit
While our application focuses on browser-based accessibility, mobile-native frameworks like **Apple’s ARKit** and **Google’s ARCore** have set the benchmark for high-fidelity tracking. ARKit, in particular, uses the TrueDepth camera system to provide **BlendShape Coefficients**, which allow for extremely responsive facial "puppeteering"—a standard our application strives to emulate using standard RGB webcams.
## Methodology
For ease of use, all demos are in the form of self-contained HTML files. They can be hosted on any static web server or run locally.

The demos all use the MediaPipe framework. The general flow is as follows:
* Acquire access to the webcam
* Initialize MediaPipe to track body parts
* Draw tracking lines and dots on an overlay window to signal to the user that tracking is taking place
* Based on the tracking data, we then do something

We now focus on what we do with the tracking data.
